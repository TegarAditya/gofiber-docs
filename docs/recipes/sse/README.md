This example demonstrates how to implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) in a Fiber application.

## Description

Server-Sent Events (SSE) allow servers to push updates to the client over a single HTTP connection. This is useful for real-time applications where the server needs to continuously send data to the client, such as live feeds, notifications, or real-time charts.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or higher
- Go modules

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/gofiber/recipes.git
    cd recipes/sse
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    go mod tidy
    ```

## Running the Application

1. Run the application:
    ```sh
    go run main.go
    ```

2. The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Endpoints

- **GET /**: Index page
- **GET /sse**: SSE route
- **PUT /publish**: Send messages via SSE

## Example Usage

By default, the example will run on port `3000`; this can be changed by modifying the `appPort` constant in `main.go`

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. The client will automatically connect to the SSE endpoint and start receiving updates from the server.
3. The `/sse` endpoint will publish the current time to the client every two seconds

### Custom Messages

To send a custom message, send a `PUT` request to the `/publish` endpoint in the following JSON format

```json
{
  "message": "Hello, World!"
}
```

Messages sent to the `/publish` endpoint will be added to a queue that is read from in FIFO order. You can test this
by using curl in an iterator

If you are using the Bash or Zsh shell:
```sh
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X PUT -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data "{\"message\":\"SSE TEST $i\"}" http://localhost:3000/publish
done
```

If you are using fish:
```sh
for i in (seq 1 10)
  curl -X PUT -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data "{\"message\":\"SSE TEST $i\"}" http://localhost:3000/publish
end
```

Once published, your added messages will begin appearing in the output at `http://localhost:3000`. Once the queue is empty
and no user-published messages are left, `/sse` will return to it's standard behavior of displaying the current time.


## Code Overview

### `main.go`

The main Go file sets up the Fiber application and handles the SSE connections. It includes the necessary configuration to send events to the client.

## Additional Information

Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a standard allowing servers to push data to web clients over HTTP. Unlike WebSockets, which require a full-duplex connection, SSE uses a unidirectional connection from the server to the client. This makes SSE simpler to implement and more efficient for scenarios where only the server needs to send updates.
